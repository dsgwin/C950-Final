# C950-Final -- WGU Data Structures and Algorithms II

This was the final project for WGU Data Structures and Algorithms II. It was developed with Python in the Pycharm IDE. The prooject data is presented in CSV format and provides a distance map of delivery locations along with a list of packages. Our task was to implement a command line application in Python that could be used to determine an optimal route. Project requirements included but were not limited to building a custom data structure (Hash Table), and an algorithm that would optimize the delivery route (Nearest Neighbor).

After the solution is complete, we also had to provide a paper analyzing the complexity of the solution with a code walkthrough which you will find attached.

The full list of project requirements has been omitted from this repository to avoid violating any of WGU's policies.
